        Programming is the future to new achievments and new goals .I choose to learn full-stack development to know more about tech.
        As a full-stack developer i can build web applications,webpages,mobile applications .I also use react(js) to build web pages  and react native for mobile applications.
        with all these are built with Javascript(which is a Scripting language for front-end development).
        for back-end development we use  Node.js and my Sql.
